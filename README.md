<h2>About Me</h2>

<p style="font-size: 18px;">
I’m currently studying Computer Science at CUNY Hunter College. My interest in tech kicked off in fourth grade when I joined the LEGO Robotics Club at PS94. That experience got me really into coding and engineering. In 2015, I competed in the First LEGO League with my team at PS94, and we did pretty well in my opinion. I've always been into STEM as a child. Back in middle school, I worked on an app project where we created a simple medical test app. It wasn't the most sophisticated app, but it was a lot of fun to work on. Now that I’m in college, I’m continuing to explore my passion for programming and developing my skills.
